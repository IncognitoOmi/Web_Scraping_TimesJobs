### Description
This script automates the process of scraping job listings from the TimesJobs website. It collects information such as job title, company name, experience required, salary, city, and the job application link. The script uses Selenium to handle dynamic content and BeautifulSoup to parse the HTML. The extracted data is then stored in a CSV file for further analysis or use.

### Code Breakdown

1. **Imports**: The script imports necessary libraries including `selenium`, `beautifulsoup4`, `numpy`, and `pandas`.
2. **Main Function**: 
   - Initializes the Chrome WebDriver.
   - Navigates to the TimesJobs website.
   - Waits for the page to load and attempts to close any pop-ups.
   - Uses BeautifulSoup to parse the page content and find job listings.
3. **Data Extraction**:
   - Iterates through the job listings to extract the job title, company name, experience, salary, city, and the application link.
   - Appends the extracted data into a list.
4. **Data Storage**:
   - Converts the list into a Pandas DataFrame.
   - Saves the DataFrame to a CSV file with the current date in the filename.
